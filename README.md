# express4 - boilerplate
Stripdown of sahat's hackathon starter. You can find that [here](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)

## Installation

You can clone it
```
git clone
```

And then  you have to run
```
npm install
```

## Frameworks used

1. I use swig instead of jade here because that's my personal framework.
2. I also use SASS as opposed to less, but these are minor changes that you can fix yourself. I'll probably add a branch with jade and less later.
3. I use bower to install all of my jQuery, BootStrap, and Angular. This app is not set up on angular but it's supposed to be bear and you can build your own version of angular as you choose.
4. I've kept the models and test there for now as examples, but feel free to destroy them and use them as examples for your own test.
